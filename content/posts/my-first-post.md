## Introduction

Welcome to my website, this is my first post!
This site will mosty act as a diary and a place to send out/record updates about my projects.
I do plan on having several projects underway at any given time, so progress on some may faulter from time to time. 


Including:
- This Website
- My programming language Sproc
- A text editor/IDE
- Several game ideas (implemented in godot or via C/C++/Rust and OpenGL)
- A secure messanger app
- A voice training app for iOS and Android for singers, and trans people
- And perhaps more (maybe a linux distro)


You can find my active software projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Emilia-Anette-Swedlund)
