## Introduction

For the last few years I've played very little in the way of gaming, mostly just Overwatch,
Minecraft, and a few other game for a bit every once and awhile, but those two were my main
ones. I love Overwatch, but the matchmaking issues that have faced it since season 2 of 
OW2 have made me stop playing it, not to mention the fact that it is the only reason I
ever boot to windows literally ever. Which is just more effort than it is worth unless
I'm playing with friends. That being said, Steams recent progress on Proton has made many
more games playable easier than ever. Thanks Gabe! I've been playing more and more games
on my linux SSD, the newest one I've been playing is 7 Days To Die. A voxal based (but not
cube looking.) survival game. Been playing it with my brother and its been a super fun time.
I haven't felt this engaged in any game since minecraft years and years ago. It's Amazing.

## What makes it different?

I think a few things put 7 Days to Die above any other games I've played recently. 
Firstly because it is voxel based this means that everything in the game is destructable. 
So if you see somethng you can destory it. But unlike games like minecraft the goal of 
this game is to survive, not to simply take over everything, and the game is balanced 
accordingly. Meaning enemies are actually challanging, and can overwhelm you if you 
are not careful. It reminds me a lot of early beta minecraft (pre adventure update AKA
the day they added the 3 worst things ever to minecraft, beds, sprinting, and the food 
system) but thats a topic for a different time. Due to this balance it makes the game
challenging and also very rewarding. it makes it feel like the world is way way bigger than
it actually is simply because its a challange to go from one place to the other. 

On top of that, the map is well designed, with higher populated areas and less populated 
areas being obvious targets for looking/foraging, but also having the reasonsably expected
difference in zombie population of a town vs the woods. 

All being said I do think I'll play a lot more of this game going forward, as I've barely
even scratched the surface of it, and have already gotten to the point of thinking about it
in bed after we sign off for the night. That being said there are some problems.

## The major flaws.

Obviously the bigget flaw conceptually with this game is that it not [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software), 
but personally I'm a but more forgiving of games not being FOSS, this is probably due to
the lack of good quality FOSS games. But there are a few notable ones. like [RedEclipse](https://www.redeclipse.net/)
which does have its own set of issues.


The only other big issues I have with the game so far is the lighting, ambeint lighting 
effets both indoors and outdoors. So after the sunsets, inside stuctures also get darker. 
even fully underground ones with no natural lighting. This isn't a major thing, but it is
enough to be a bit annoying sometimes.
